GENERAL NOTES
-------------

  Herein lies a tool to aid in the conversion from DjVu to PDF of the
  book "The Mathematical Theory of Communication" by Claude E. Shannon
  and Warren Weaver.

  The source file is a DjVu copy of the book's eighth paperback
  printing, published in 1980.  This source file is not included and
  must be acquired elsewhere.  The MD5 hash of the DjVu file is:

  4c4609e69eed2ccf998ec2b575c932cc


EXTRACTING PAGES FROM DJVU FILE
-------------------------------

  The pages of the DjVu document can be extracted as a set of bi-level
  images with the following command:

  make pbm

  The resulting images will be in Netpbm format and can be found under
  the pbm/ directory.


BOOK DIMENSIONS
---------------

  The following notes do not take the front and back cover into
  consideration and concern only the book's enclosing pages.

  Once the pages have been extracted from the DjVu file at their
  native resolution, it can been seen that the page dimensions
  uniform:

  make pbm
  identify -format '%wx%h\n' pbm/*.pbm

  The output of the above commands reveals that the pages are either
  1568, 1600, or 1632 pixels wide with a 1600-pixel width being the
  most common:

  | WIDTH | PAGES |
  |-------+-------|
  |  1568 |    30 |
  |  1600 |    95 |
  |  1632 |     5 |

  The pages are either 2368 or 2400 pixels in height:

  | HEIGHT | PAGES |
  |--------+-------|
  |   2368 |    70 |
  |   2400 |    60 |
  
  The range of width and heights are in discrete steps of 32 pixels.

  It has been decided that the enclosing pages dimensions of the
  converted PDF document will be 1600 by 2400 pixels as this gives a
  nice ratio of 2:3.

  Looking at both the width and height of each page, only four of the
  possible six combinations occur:

  | DIMENSIONS | PAGES |
  |------------+-------|
  |  1568x2368 |    30 |
  |  1600x2368 |    40 |
  |  1600x2400 |    55 |
  |  1632x2400 |     5 |
