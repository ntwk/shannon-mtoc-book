GENERAL NOTES
-------------

  This package provides tools to aid in the conversion from DjVu to
  PDF of the book "The Mathematical Theory of Communication" by Claude
  E. Shannon and Warren Weaver.

  The source file is a DjVu copy of the eighth paperback printing of
  the book, published in 1980.  This source file is not provided and
  must be acquired elsewhere.  The MD5 hash of the source DjVU file
  is:

  4c4609e69eed2ccf998ec2b575c932cc


EXTRACTING PAGES FROM DJVU FILE
-------------------------------

  All pages from the DjVu document can be extracted as a bi-level
  image in with the following command:

  ddjvu -format=pbm -eachpage -1 The-Mathematical-Theory-of-Communication.djvu out_%03d.pbm

  The -1 switch ensures that the output images are at the native
  resolution of the DjVu file.


BOOK DIMENSIONS
---------------

  The following notes do not take the front and back cover into
  consideration and concern only the book's enclosing pages.

  The page dimensions in the original DjVu document are not uniform.
  Page widths are either 1568, 1600, or 1632 pixels with 1600 being
  the most common:

  | WIDTH | PAGES |
  |-------+-------|
  |  1568 |    30 |
  |  1600 |    95 |
  |  1632 |     5 |

  Page heights are either 2368 or 2400 pixels:

  | HEIGHT | PAGES |
  |--------+-------|
  |   2368 |    70 |
  |   2400 |    60 |
  
  I noted the range of width and heights are in discrete steps of 32
  pixels.

  I have decided that the dimensions of the restored document will be
  1600x2400 as this gives a nice ratio of 2:3.

  Looking at both the width and height of each page, only four of the
  possible six combinations appear:

  | DIMENSIONS | PAGES |
  |------------+-------|
  |  1568x2368 |    30 |
  |  1600x2368 |    40 |
  |  1600x2400 |    55 |
  |  1632x2400 |     5 |
